# Gene_vs_sites_model
Description of scripts:

>>BCComputerCodes_1.rtf\
Program for Properties of Deterministic Equilibrium Populations: This program uses iteration to calculate the equilibrium haplotype frequencies and load statistics for the two-locus gene and sites models with no recombination, allowing for epistasis.\

>>Program for Simulating Two Segregating Loci: This program simulates a haploid population with two segregating sites with no recombination, allowing weights to be applied towards low allele frequencies by the methods of Garcia & Lohmueller (2021) or Good (2022)
