Description of scripts:
>>1_two_site_simulations/\
>>BC_ComputerCode_1.f90\
Program for Properties of Deterministic Equilibrium Populations: This program uses iteration to calculate the equilibrium haplotype frequencies and load statistics for the two-locus gene and sites models with no recombination, allowing for epistasis.\
>>
>>BC_ComputerCode_2.f90\
>>Program for Simulating Two Segregating Loci: This program simulates a haploid population with two segregating sites with no recombination, allowing weights to be applied towards low allele frequencies by the methods of Garcia & Lohmueller (2021) or Good (2022)\
>>
>>BC_ComputerCode_3.f90\
>>Program for Simulating Samples from a Population with Two Segregating Loci: This program simulates repeatied sampling from a population with two loci with the same allele frequency at each locus and a specified value of  D. The full set of D values for a fixed number of replicates can be stored.
